    """Partially observable merge environment.

    This environment is used to train autonomous vehicles to attenuate the
    formation and propagation of waves in an open merge network.
    该环境用于训练自动驾驶车辆，以衰减开放合并网络中波浪的形成和传播。

    Required from env_params:

    * max_accel: maximum acceleration for autonomous vehicles, in m/s^2
    * max_decel: maximum deceleration for autonomous vehicles, in m/s^2
    * target_velocity: desired velocity for all vehicles in the network, in m/s
    * num_rl: maximum number of controllable vehicles in the network

    States
        The observation consists of the speeds and bumper-to-bumper headways of
        the vehicles immediately preceding and following autonomous vehicle, as
        well as the ego speed of the autonomous vehicles.
        观察包括自动驾驶车辆前后车辆的速度和保险杠间距，以及自动驾驶车辆的自我速度。

        In order to maintain a fixed observation size, when the number of AVs
        in the network is less than "num_rl", the extra entries are filled in
        with zeros. Conversely, if the number of autonomous vehicles is greater
        than "num_rl", the observations from the additional vehicles are not
        included in the state space.
        为了保持固定的观测大小，当网络中的AVs数量小于“num_rl”时，额外的条目用零填充。
        相反，如果自动驾驶车辆的数量大于“num_rl”，则状态空间中不包括来自其他车辆的观察结果。

    Actions
        The action space consists of a vector of bounded accelerations for each
        autonomous vehicle $i$. In order to ensure safety, these actions are
        bounded by failsafes provided by the simulator at every time step.
        动作空间由每个自动驾驶车辆$i$的有界加速度向量组成。为了确保安全，这些动作在每个时间步骤都受到模拟器提供的故障保护的限制。

        In order to account for variability in the number of autonomous
        vehicles, if n_AV < "num_rl" the additional actions provided by the
        agent are not assigned to any vehicle. Moreover, if n_AV > "num_rl",
        the additional vehicles are not provided with actions from the learning
        agent, and instead act as human-driven vehicles as well.
        为了说明自动驾驶车辆数量的可变性，如果n_AV<“num_rl”，则智能体提供的附加操作不会分配给任何车辆。
        此外，如果n_AV>“num_rl”，则其他车辆不会被学习智能体提供动作，而是充当人类驾驶的车辆。
    Rewards
        The reward function encourages proximity of the system-level velocity
        to a desired velocity, while slightly penalizing small time headways
        among autonomous vehicles.
        奖励功能鼓励系统级速度接近期望速度，同时稍微惩罚自动驾驶车辆之间的小时间间隔。
    Termination
        A rollout is terminated if the time horizon is reached or if two
        vehicles collide into one another.
        如果到达时间范围或两辆车相撞，则卷展将终止。
